### Financial Sustainability

#### Revenue Streams

**1. Membership Fees**

Projected 1,500 paid members in Year 1:

- 1,500 members × ₹350 annual fee = ₹5,25,000 gross revenue
- Less payment fees (2%) = ₹5,14,500 net revenue
- Less platform costs (₹86,000 typical) = **₹4,28,500 net surplus**

**Platform is financially sustainable and self-funding** with substantial surplus available for community programs and initiatives.

**2. Business Sponsorships**

- Local Mizo-owned businesses and firms can sponsor platform features
- Estimated ₹50,000 - ₹1,00,000 annually in sponsorship revenue
- Helps offset initial development and production costs

**3. Advertisement Revenue**

- In-app advertisements from relevant businesses
- Revenue grows proportionally with user base
- Estimated ₹20,000 - ₹50,000 annually in Year 1, scaling up as users increase

#### Growth Scenario (Years 2-3)

With 2,000 - 2,500 members by Years 2-3:

- 2,500 × ₹350 = ₹8,75,000 gross membership revenue
- Plus sponsorships and ads = ₹1,00,000 - ₹2,00,000
- **Total revenue: ₹9,75,000 - ₹10,75,000**
- Net after costs = **₹8,00,000 - ₹9,00,000 surplus** available for community programs
