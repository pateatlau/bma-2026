### Financial Sustainability

#### Revenue Streams

**1. Membership Fees**

Projected 1,500 paid members in Year 1:

- 1,500 members × ₹350 annual fee = ₹5,25,000 gross revenue
- Less payment fees (2%) = ₹5,14,500 net revenue

**Platform is highly profitable** and generates substantial surplus for community initiatives.

**2. Business Sponsorships**

- Local Mizo-owned businesses and firms can sponsor platform features
- Estimated ₹50,000 - ₹1,00,000 annually in sponsorship revenue
- Helps offset initial development and production costs

**3. Advertisement Revenue**

- In-app advertisements from relevant businesses
- Revenue grows proportionally with user base
- Estimated ₹20,000 - ₹50,000 annually in Year 1, scaling up as users increase

#### Growth Scenario (Years 2-3)

With 2,000 - 2,500 members by Years 2-3:

- 2,500 × ₹350 = ₹8,75,000 gross membership revenue
- Plus sponsorships and ads = ₹1,00,000 - ₹2,00,000
- **Total revenue: ₹9,75,000 - ₹10,75,000**
- Net after costs = **₹8,00,000 - ₹9,00,000 surplus** available for community programs

## Why Launch on March 21, 2026

### Strategic Timing

- **BMA Annual Day** - Maximum community visibility and engagement
- **Symbol of Progress** - Modern platform demonstrates BMA's forward-thinking leadership
- **Perfect for New Term** - BMA's annual membership runs April - March. Platform launches just in time for the 2026-27 membership cycle, enabling immediate digital registrations for all new and renewing members
- **Web Launch Guaranteed** - Platform will be live on web regardless of mobile app store approvals

### Phased Release Plan

| Platform            | Launch Status            | Timeline               |
| ------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| **Web**             | Full launch on March 21  | Confirmed              |
| **Mobile Internal** | Testing builds available | March 21               |
| **Mobile Public**   | Play Store & App Store   | 2-3 months post-launch |

**Note:** Mobile public release depends on BMA organizational accounts (requires PAN card and D-U-N-S Number). Web platform and mobile testing proceed regardless.

### Competitive Advantage
