# Project Rules

## General

- This is a real production-style Expo project
- Code must be runnable, not illustrative
- Prefer correctness and clarity over cleverness

## Platform

- Target: Web, Android, iOS
- Use Expo (latest stable SDK)
- Use Expo Router for navigation
- One shared codebase for all platforms

## Restrictions

- Do NOT use web-only libraries (no react-router-dom, no Next.js)
- Do NOT use deprecated APIs
- Do NOT invent libraries

## Code Quality

- Maintain clean file structure
- Avoid duplicated logic
- Ensure navigation and providers are wired correctly
- Handle platform differences intentionally

## UI

- Red, black, and white theme
- Clean, modern, professional look
- Avoid default-looking starter UI

## Behavior

- Think through architecture before writing code
- If unsure, resolve the uncertainty before outputting code
- Fix issues fully, not partially
